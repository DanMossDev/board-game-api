# Northcoders House of Games API

## Intro
This API will allow users to view, update, and edit a variety of information pertaining to board games, including:
- Rewiews
- Users
- Categories of games

For security reasons, .env variables have been obscured in this repository - as such you will have to include your own .env.development file in the following format:

```
PGDATABASE=nc_games
PGPASSWORD="your-password"
```

Users on Linux must include the password variable; those on Mac may find it unneccesary.

Thanks, and enjoy!
